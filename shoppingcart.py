#Store prices as well as names. DONE
#Change the add functionality to also ask for and store the price of the item. DONE
#Change the display functionality to also display the prices of the items. DONE
#When displaying the items, display a number in front of each item. The numbers should start with 1.
#Complete the option to display the total amount of the prices of all the items in the shopping cart.
#Whenever prices are displayed, they should be shown to two decimal places and include the appropriate currency symbol (for example $, â‚¬, etc.)
#Complete the option to remove an item from the shopping cart.
#When removing an item, you should verify the following:
#Both the item name and price are removed from their respective lists.
#The number the user enters should be converted to a 0-based index and checked to make sure it is within the bounds of the list.
#The program allows you to remove any item from the list including the first one and the last one. (Sometimes, if you have a bug in your project you might not allow removing the last item as you should.)
